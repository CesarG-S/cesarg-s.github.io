## Selfie

Here is the difference between taking a zoomed-in photo and a far-away photo of my face.

Pretend something is here.

## Landscape

Here is a building.

Pretend something is here.

## Dolly Zoom

Ever wonder how it feels to be a 15th century peasant walking the streets of Florence? Now you can! Simply walk down to San Francisco and head up to the Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill. I now understand the "hill" part of Nob Hill. You can also take the bus. Or drive. Maybe don't drive, actually. (some assembly is required) (Ralsei plush not included)
