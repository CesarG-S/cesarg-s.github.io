## Selfie Perspective

Here is the difference between taking a close-up unzoomed photo, and a far-away zoomed-in photo of my face. It's pretty jarring. The second photo was taken with about 12x zoom, so my phone must have used the telephoto zoom camera, which explains the different coloration and quality, but the little moustache hairs going over my lip are pretty solid evidence that these photos were taken at roughly the same time.

## Architectural Perspective

I was looking for places on campus to take photos, and it took me a while to get some decent shots because people spaced themselves out in a way while they were walking such that there was always someone in frame when it was time to take a picture. I ended up giving up on my spot and moved somewhere more isolated, and found the Dwinelle Annex. If the sun wasn't setting, and there weren't people walking by, I'd probably try lining up the photos better, but I think the effect is still visible in the windows and the horizontal lines created by the building facade. The building's lines are fairly parallel in the image on the left, while the building's lines would converge if allowed to extend beyond the building in the image on the right.

After I took those photos, I was walking towards downtown, and I figured I should take a photo of the Anchor House just in case my photos of the Dwinelle Annex didn't turn out great. Although I didn't line the building up perfectly, it still showcases the effect to an extent. I do really like how straight the windows are in the image on the left.

## Dolly Zoom

Ever wonder how it feels to be a 15th century peasant walking the streets of Florence? Now you can! Simply walk down to San Francisco and head up to the Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill. I now understand the "hill" part of Nob Hill. You can also take the bus. Or drive. Maybe don't drive, actually. (some assembly is required) (Ralsei plush not included)
